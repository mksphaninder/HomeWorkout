Workout for beginners
Now a dayâ€™s people are cautious about health and physic and spend a lot on trainers when they join gym. Not all can afford a trainer and gym. Moreover, people with jobs cannot manage time to go to gym. I wanted to create an app where beginners can learn workouts just by looking at the description at home. I want to list out basic workouts with images and information regarding calories burnt for one hour. I want to add step by step workout image and a YouTube link for video about that workout, With this people can easily save time and money and still maintain health.
